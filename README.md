# fund-me

This repo contains a Fund Me smart contract coded in Solidity. It allows a user to send funds in Ethereum via a fund me function and the same funds can be colected into other account via the withdraw function.
It uses AggregatorV3Interface, a Chainlink Data feeds feature to get the live market conversion rate of ETH in USD. 


#### Here's a quick demonstration of above mentioned functions on Remix IDE :
